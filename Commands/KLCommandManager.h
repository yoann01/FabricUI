    KLCommandManager has a reference to the KL command manager so it can create KL commands. 
    However, the C++ manager isn't automatically synchronized with the KL manager. If commands 
    are added to the KL manager directly, the C++ manager needs explicitly to synchronize with it. 
    
    Two scenarios are possible. First, the KL manager creates KL commands. Specials C++ commands 
    (KLCommand-KLScriptableCommand) that wrap KL commands are created. Secondly, C++ commands are 
    asked to be created frrom KL. An 'AppCommand' command  is created in KL. When the two managers 
    are synchronized, the C++ manager detects the KL 'AppCommand', and creates the real C++ command.
    
    The method `synchronizeKL` must be call to synchronize the managers.
