  /**
    CommandManager contains and manages the command undo-redo stack. It's in charge of creating  
    the commands, executing and undo-redoing them. CommandManager is specialized depending on   
    the command registration system, C++ vs Phyton, cf, CommandManager for C++ implementation, 
    CommandManager_Python and Python/Canvas/CommandManager.py for Python. 

    The manager can be shared between C++ and Python, so commands defined in Python can be created
    from C++, and vice versa. The manager can only create commands /C++/Python) registered in 
    the registry. When a command is added to the stack, the signal `commandDone` is emitted. 
    
    A manager can be set/get as a singleton:
    - Set the singleton: CommandManager::setCommandManagerSingleton(new CommandManager());
    - Get the singleton: CommandManager *cmdManager = CommandManager::getCommandManager();
