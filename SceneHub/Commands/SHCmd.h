    SHCmd is the base class to wrap a KL SHCmd into a C++ command.
    It defines all the needed methods to be inserted in third-party stack (QUndoStack).
    
    By default, the command description (what its diplayed in the stack)
    is the command KL type.

    In order to specialize the command description, it's necessary to override this class 
    and register it as a QMetaType by implementing the registerCommand method.

    Any command should inherate from this class.
